After setting a phenomenal trend on PC and selling tremendously well on Xbox Live Arcade, Mojang's incredibly addictive world-creation game Minecraft has made the jump to physical media! The charm of Minecraft is in its crude, blocky graphics. As you wander about a seemingly empty map, you soon learn to use your trusty pickaxe to chisel away the environment around you. Doing so not only allows you to rebuild the entire map as you see fit, but can also throw up a number of interesting surprises. Create buildings, caverns, landmarks... you're only limited by your imagination. If you like, you can invite a bunch of friends along to help you build a masterpiece worthy of showing the entire world. But be quick about it, because at night monsters come out to play, so you need to make sure that you have made preparations for you (and your friends) to stay safe until dawn. The PlayStation 4 Edition comes with its own set of features. Players can use the DualShock 4's touchpad to navigate menus and craft, and of course they can use the console's social features to share their creations with friends! PlayStation 3 players who've upgraded to a PS4 won't be left out in the cold, either - they'll be able to transfer their saves to the new generation version.
